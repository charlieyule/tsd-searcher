# TSD Searcher

A Tandem Site Duplication (TSD) Searcher, written in TypeScript and built on
Deno.

This is a re-implementation of
[AnnoSINE](https://github.com/yangli557/AnnoSINE)'s
[TSD_Searcher](https://github.com/yangli557/AnnoSINE/blob/26301e9bc61400aa461ad58fb3a254e4e33c7af4/bin/TSD_Searcher.js),
aiming to extract the non-Python dependency from AnnoSINE and make it easier to
integrate.
